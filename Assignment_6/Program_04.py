# 4. Write a Python program to check a triangle is equilateral, isosceles or scalene.
# Note :
# An equilateral triangle is a triangle in which all three sides are equal.
# A scalene triangle is a triangle that has three unequal sides.
# An isosceles triangle is a triangle with two equal sides.
# Expected Output:
# Input lengths of the triangle sides:                                    
# x: 6                                                                    
# y: 8                                                                    
# z: 12                                                                   
# Scalene triangle 

print("Input lengths of the triangle sides: ")
x = int(input("x: "))
y = int(input("y: "))
z = int(input("z: "))

if x == y == z:
	print("Equilateral triangle")
elif x==y or y==z or z==x:
	print("isosceles triangle")
else:
	print("Scalene triangle")
